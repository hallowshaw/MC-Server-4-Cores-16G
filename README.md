# Distributed JVM-Based Virtual World Executor (Build Target: P-1.21.5-87)

## ‚àÜ Preliminary Host Calibration

Commence initialization of host-node repositories and secure essential binary patches:

```bash
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## üì• Binary Fetch (P-1.21.5-87)

Grab the server-side executable from the PaperMC API:

```bash
wget https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.21.5/builds/87/downloads/paper-1.21.5-87.jar -O paper.jar
```


## ‚úÖ EULA Pre-Auth

Acknowledge the upstream terms to enable runtime boot:

```bash
echo "eula=true" > eula.txt
```


## üöÄ Runtime Invocation

Select your execution profile based on available system memory.

### Standard Profile (8GB+ RAM):

```bash
java -Xmx8G -Xms4G -jar paper.jar --nogui
```

### Enhanced Profile (16GB+ RAM):

```bash
java -Xmx16G -Xms4G -jar paper.jar --nogui
```

## üß† Notes for Operators

- Use terminal multiplexers like `tmux` or `screen` to maintain server persistence across SSH sessions.
- After the initial launch, modify `server.properties` to configure world seed, game rules, and server ports.
- For performance enhancement in production environments, consider applying [Aikar's Java flags](https://aikar.co/mcflags.html) to optimize garbage collection and thread management.
- Regularly back up `world`, `plugins`, and `config` directories to ensure data integrity during updates or crashes.
- Monitor `logs/latest.log` for runtime anomalies or plugin exceptions.
